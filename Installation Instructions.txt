Furry's Auto-Split Timer (FAST) Installation Instructions:
----------------------------------------------------------

You will need:

* LiveSplit software
* ePSXe 1.9.25
* A rom of Mega Man Legends (J)
* LiveSplit.ASLVarViewer.UI.dll (included)
* Script.ASL (included)
* Layout.LSL (included)
* Splits.LSS (included) (optional, you can make your own splits)


Step 1: Place LiveSplit.ASLVarViewer.UI.dll in the components folder in your LiveSplit directory.

Step 2: Run LiveSplit as administrator.

Step 3: Open Layout.LSL in LiveSplit.

Step 4: Open Splits.LSS if you don't have any saved splits. Skip this step if you already have splits.

Step 5: Go to Edit Layout in LiveSplit. Double click Scriptable Auto Splitter. Set the source path for the script to the Script.ASL file. Make sure all three check boxes are checked.

Step 6: Run ePSXe 1.9.25 as administrator. Load the rom of Mega Man Legends (J).

If the splitter installed correctly, the timer will automatically start when you start a new game. The timer will reflect IGT and not real time. It will automatically record all the splits in the includeded Splits.LSS file. It will also automatically reset if you die or manually reset the game.

Have fun and good luck!
